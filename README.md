# Sticky-Notes-using-Javascript-and-React
Hey Connections, 
I attended a Bootcamp of a YouTube Educational Channel , named DevTown, for 7 days. Their I learned about various features of Html, Css , Javascript and specially React. On the final day of the bootcamp, we were taught a basic Sticky Note Making Project. The respective project is the same coding file of this Bootcamp final day assignment.

It was a great experience that I had from August 26, 2022 till September 3, 2022. And I learned a lot from it too.
